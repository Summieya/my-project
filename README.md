# my-project
This is a HTML-CSS-based e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. 
Online Mart - E-commerce Website (Similar to Flipkart, Blinkit, Amazon)
This project is a frontend-focused e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the basic structure and functionality of popular online retail platforms such as Flipkart, Blinkit, and Amazon, offering users the ability to browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed with a simulated checkout process.
While the website is fully functional on the frontend, the backend integration is still a work in progress. Future updates will include features like secure payment gateways, order management, user authentication, and backend database integration.

Features:
